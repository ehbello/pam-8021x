 pam_8021x authentication PAM module
=====================================

This is the PAM to 802.1x protocol authentication module.  It allows any
Linux machine to become a 802.1x client for authentication.

This module talks with NetworkManager daemon sending messages trough D-BUS
system to get authentication with 802.1x protocol.

This first version only creates the needed network connection for a
specific 802.1x configuration with PEAP/MSCHAPv2 authentication. It still
does not check if authentication success.
